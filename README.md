🖋 Product Sales Campaign 🖨
This project was my final practical exam for my Data Analyst Professional certification with Python and SQL at DataCamp.


Synopsis 📋
Pens and Printers was founded in 1984 as a brick-and-mortar wholesale supply company. Its business is reselling high-quality office products to large organizations, i.e. it operates in the Business-to-Business (B2B) segment.

Pens and Printers distributes a wide range of premium office supplies — from small stationery accessories through office furniture to computer hardware.

Pens and Printers adapted to the changing business environment by branching into online services. The company added an e-commerce website to its distribution channels to better serve its customers, as it realized that many businesses procure their office supplies in new ways.

Pens and Printers is aware that its sales strategies need to adopt new tactics to better address the evolving purchase behavior of its clients.


Objective 🎯
Six weeks ago Pens and Printers launched a new product line of office stationery.

Launching a new product line incurs high expenses and the company is looking for the best techniques to sell the new products most cost-effectively.

For the new product line launch Pens and Printers applied three different sales strategies to three different customer groups.

Sales Strategy	Execution	Time and Effort
targeted email	one email sent at product launch,
a follow-up email three weeks later	requires very little work from the sales team
phone call	phone call by a sales representative	average phone call duration:
30 minutes per customer
email and phone call	one email sent at product launch,
a follow-up phone call by a sales representative a week later	email requires very little effort;
average follow-up phone call duration:
10 minutes per customer
This data analysis aims at answering the following questions about Pens and Printers' latest sales campaign:

How many customers were there for each sales approach?
What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?
Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the sales methods?
Based on the data (time, effort, results per sales strategy), which method would you recommend we continue to use?
Provide context about customer groups, an overview of what is going on, and what to do next.
